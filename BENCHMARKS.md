# Benchmarks
**All values below labeled "Target" are goals for future experiments, not guarantees.**
Measured results will be added with: date, dataset, method, hardware, and reproducible scripts.

| Metric | Target | Measured (link) | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Bitrate @1080p60 | 2–5 Mbps | — | Controlled scenes first |
| Motion-to-photon | ≤ 50 ms | — | Edge inference only |
| Mobile energy | 20–40% over AV1 | — | Depends on NPU gen |
