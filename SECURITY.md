# Security Posture (Research Repo)

This is a **research-only** repository (docs, notes, samples). No runtime services, secrets, or network endpoints.
- Vulnerability reports: use GitHub Security Advisories.
- No production dependencies; CI checks docs/link hygiene only.
- Tokens are out of scope here; none are implemented or live.
